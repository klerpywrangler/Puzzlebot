# PuzzBot Development Diary

## Sprint 1 Progress

### Infrastructure & Architecture Setup

#### Completed Tasks:
1. **Repository Setup**
   - Git repository initialized
   - Project structure established

2. **Backend Foundation (Strapi)**
   - Strapi installed and configured
   - Puzzle content type created with required fields
   - API permissions configured

3. **Frontend Scaffold (Refine.dev)**
   - Refine.dev installed with Material UI
   - Data provider configured for Strapi integration
   - Basic layout implemented
   - Routing structure established

4. **Configuration Details**
   - Data Provider: Using `@refinedev/strapi-v4`
   - API URL: Configured to `https://api.strapi-v4.refine.dev/api`
   - Authentication: JWT-based with token stored in cookies
   - Axios instance configured with automatic token injection

#### Current Status:
- Frontend and backend infrastructure is in place
- Data provider is properly configured for Strapi
- Basic authentication flow is implemented

#### Next Steps:
1. Complete the Railway deployment
2. Begin implementing the BaseGenerator framework
3. Start work on the Maze Generator implementation

#### Technical Decisions:
1. **Data Provider Choice**: Selected `@refinedev/strapi-v4` for seamless Strapi integration
2. **Authentication**: Using JWT tokens stored in cookies for secure authentication
3. **API Structure**: Following Strapi's REST API conventions with `/api` prefix

#### Challenges & Solutions:
1. **Challenge**: Setting up proper data provider configuration
   **Solution**: Implemented custom axios instance with token management

#### Notes:
- Need to ensure proper error handling in the data provider
- Consider implementing refresh token logic
- May need to adjust API URL based on deployment environment
