## Development Diary

### Project Setup - Day 1

1. Initial Setup
   - Created basic folder structure (frontend, backend, docs)
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created .gitignore file with Node.js and React patterns
   - Created initial README.md with project structure and setup instructions

2. Frontend Setup Decisions
   - Selected Refine.dev for frontend framework
   - Decided to use Vite template for better development experience
   - Will use Material UI for components

3. Frontend Implementation & Troubleshooting
   - Discovered frontend app was in a misnamed folder (`refine-project`)
   - Renamed `refine-project` to `frontend` for clarity and consistency
   - Installed all dependencies in the correct directory
   - Started the dev server from within the `frontend` directory
   - Confirmed the Refine frontend is now visible in the browser (login page loads)
   - Note: The app is running on a port other than 5173 due to a port conflict (e.g., 3000)

4. Backend Setup (Strapi)
   - Successfully installed and initialized Strapi in the backend directory
   - Used quickstart option for rapid development setup
   - Confirmed Node.js (v22.15.0) and npm (10.9.2) versions
   - Created admin user and accessed admin panel at localhost:1337/admin
   - Ready for content type configuration

5. Backend Content & API Implementation
   - Created Puzzle content type with all required fields
   - Successfully created and published test maze puzzle
   - Configured API permissions for public access
   - Implemented API token authentication for testing
   - **Known Issue**: Single puzzle endpoint (/api/puzzles/:id) returns 404
   - **Workaround Decision**: Will use list endpoint with filters for single puzzle retrieval
   - **Future Task**: Investigate and fix single puzzle endpoint issue

6. API Testing Results
   - List endpoint (/api/puzzles) works perfectly
   - Successfully returns puzzle data with proper structure
   - API token authentication working as expected
   - Confirmed data format matches frontend requirements
   - Documented API response structure for frontend integration

7. Next Steps
   - Proceed with frontend-backend integration
   - Implement frontend data fetching using list endpoint
   - Create workaround for single puzzle view using filters
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Return to fix single puzzle endpoint issue post-MVP

### Technical Decisions
- Using Vite for frontend development (faster development experience)
- Material UI for component library
- JSON format for puzzle data storage
- Documentation-Driven Development approach
- Strapi v4 data provider for backend integration
- Ensured clean and consistent folder structure for maintainability
- Using Strapi's quickstart setup for rapid development
- Using list endpoint with filters as temporary solution for single puzzle retrieval
- Implementing API token authentication for enhanced security

### Known Issues & Future Improvements
1. Single Puzzle API Endpoint
   - Current Status: Returns 404 for valid IDs
   - Temporary Solution: Use list endpoint with filters
   - Impact: Minimal for MVP but needs resolution
   - Priority: Medium (post-MVP)

2. Port Management
   - Experienced port conflicts during development
   - Need to implement better port management strategy
   - Consider adding configuration files for port settings
